# THINGS WE NEED TO DO
- html in templates
- add classes to models.py (Dylan plans on finishing this tonight(fri) and tomorrow(sat))
- link classes to server with urls.py (so that it displays)
- Create Views in views.py
-make sure classes can be created and written to the database properly (I was having trouble creating new objects, when i tried to create a customer I got an error because I think the customer constructor isn't set up properly)
-Add a registration page (register button on login page, and then a form where customer enters info)
-create bookings option: configure so customer can create. right now we can just set it up so the customer creates a booking for ?something? at a certain time and store it in the database. Then once we have the vehicle class set up we can link a vehicle with the booking. So i guess
-Get vehicle class set up
